# keep.nvim

Simple Neovim session manager that helps you keep track of your opened files per project.

Automatically saves on exit and loads on demand.

## ‚ú® Features

- Automatically saves all open file buffers on exit
- Restore all previously opened files with a single keypress
- Focus remains on the file you launched Neovim with (e.g. `nvim myfile.txt`)
- Uses hashed working directory path to avoid name collisions
- Lightweight and dependency-free

## üì¶ Installation (using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim))

```lua
{
    "am2b/keep.nvim",
    event = { 'VeryLazy' },

    -- You can change the default key bindings here
    -- This will override the plugin's internal default mapping
    keys = {
        { "<space>ls", "<cmd>lua require('keep').load_session()<cr>", desc = "Restore session" }
    },

    config = function()
        require("keep").setup()
    end,
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Automatically saves buffers on exit

Whenever you exit Neovim, `keep.nvim` will record the list of open file buffers in a session file, specific to your current working directory.

The session file name is a SHA256 hash of your full working directory path, which ensures that similarly named folders (like `~/project/foo` and `~/work/foo`) don't conflict.

### Restore buffers manually

After launching Neovim in the same working directory, press:

```
<space>ls
```

This will restore the buffer list from the last session, without changing the focus away from the file you‚Äôre currently editing.

### Example

```sh
# Day 1
$ cd my-project
$ nvim main.py utils.py

# Files are saved on exit

# Day 2
$ cd my-project
$ nvim README.md        # you‚Äôre editing README.md now
# Press <space>ls       # main.py and utils.py will be restored silently, and the focus will STILL remain on README.md ‚úÖ
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works

- Session files are saved to: `~/.local/state/nvim/keep/<hash>.txt`
- The first line of each file contains the original working directory path (commented)
- Only real files are tracked (no help buffers, terminals, etc.)
- Buffer focus is preserved on restore
